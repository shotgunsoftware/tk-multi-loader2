    # hooks
    actions_hook:

        description: Hook which contains all methods for action management.

    filter_publishes_hook:

        description: Specify a hook that, if needed, can filter the raw list of publishes returned
                     from ShotGrid for the current location.

        description: Controls whether thumbnails should be downloaded from ShotGrid or not. We
                     strongly recommend that thumbnails are downloaded since this greatly enhances
                     the user experience of the loader, however in some situations this may be
                     difficult due to bandwidth or infrastructural restrictions.

                      This setting is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list defines one tab.
                      Dictionaries with their *type* key set to 'Hierarchy' should have they following keys:
                      *caption* specifies the name of the tab, *root* specifies the path to the root
                      of the project hierarchy to display.

                      type to display. *filters* is a list of standard API ShotGrid filters.
                      *hierarchy* is a list of ShotGrid fields, defining the grouping of the tree.
                      Optionally, you can specify a *publish_filters* key, containing ShotGrid API filters to
