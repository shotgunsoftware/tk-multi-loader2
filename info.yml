    menu_name:

        default_value: "Load"
        description: Name to appear on the Shotgun menu.

    # hooks
    actions_hook:
        type: hook
        default_value: "{self}/{engine_name}_actions.py"
        description: Hook which contains all methods for action management.

    filter_publishes_hook:
        type: hook
        default_value: "{self}/filter_publishes.py"
        description: Specify a hook that, if needed, can filter the raw list of publishes returned
                     from Shotgun for the current location.

    download_thumbnails:
        type: bool
        default_value: true
        description: Controls whether thumbnails should be downloaded from Shotgun or not. We
                     strongly recommend that thumbnails are downloaded since this greatly enhances
                     the user experience of the loader, however in some situations this may be
                     difficult due to bandwidth or infrastructural restrictions.

    action_mappings:
        type: dict
        description: Associates published file types with actions. The actions are all defined
                     inside the actions hook, so a number of actions are available by default
                     and in addition to this you can add your own actions if you like.

                      This setting is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list defines one tab,
                      and should have they following keys: *caption* specifies the name of the tab, *entity_type*
                      specifies the shotgun entity type to display. *filters* is a list of standard API Shotgun 
                      filters. *hierarchy* is a list of shotgun fields, defining the grouping of the tree.
                      Optionally, you can specify a *publish_filters* key, containing shotgun API filters to
                      apply to the publishes listing as it is being loaded in the main view."
