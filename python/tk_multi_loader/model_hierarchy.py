        Initializes a Shotgun Hierarchy model instance and loads a hierarchy
        that leads to entities that are linked via the ``PublishedFile.entity``
        field.

        :param parent: The model parent.
        :type parent: :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QObject`

        :param dict root_entity: The entity which will act as the root of the
            hierarchy to display. By default, this value is ``None``, which will
            default to the entire site.

        :param bg_task_manager: Background task manager to use for any
            asynchronous work. If this is ``None`` a task manager will be
            created as needed.
        :type bg_task_manager: :class:`~task_manager.BackgroundTaskManager`

        :param str include_root: Defines the name of an additional, top-level
            model item that represents the root. In views, this item will appear
            as a sibling to top-level children of the root. This allows for
            UX whereby a user can select an item representing the root without
            having a UI that shows a single, top-level item. An example would
            be displaying published file entity hierarchy with top level items:
            "Assets", "Shots", and "Project Publishes". In this example, the
            supplied arg would look like: ``include_root="Project Publishes"``.
            If ``include_root`` is `None`, no root item will be added.
