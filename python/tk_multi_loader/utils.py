    Event filter which emits a resized signal whenever

    # it's easiest to parent it to the object that is
    # being monitored (in this case self.ui.thumbnail)
    filter = ResizeEventFilter(self.ui.thumbnail)

    # __on_thumb_resized slot gets called every time
    # the widget is resized
    filter.resized.connect(self.__on_thumb_resized)

    # finally, install the event filter into the QT
    # event system
